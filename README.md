README.md

This folder contains several code samples that I created and have found to be continually useful.  They are all in self-contained html files.

Circle_divs.html shows how to turn your divs into circles by using a border radius of 50%.

Craps.html uses the technique above and incorporates the circles as pips on dice, which are then used in a simple "street" version
of craps.	Includes some decent, fully-validated, JavaScript code.

Nav_bar_display_all.html displays several of the menu bars I used for my site at www.bruceAsmith.com
and is helpful when coming up with color schemes.

My_dialogue_box.html is a demo of my custom-made dialog box.  It also uses an SVG graphic, which I included in order to make the page an official "one page" sample.
