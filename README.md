README.md

This folder contains several code samples that I found useful.  They are all in self-contained html files.

circle_divs.html shows how to turn your divs into circles simply by using a border radius of 50%.

nav_bar_display_all.html displays several of the menu bars I used for my site at www.bruceAsmith.com
and is helpful when coming up with color schemes.
