README.md

This folder contains several code samples that I found useful.  They are all in self-contained html files.

Circle_divs.html shows how to turn your divs into circles by using a border radius of 50%.

Craps.html uses the technique above and incorporates the circles as pips on dice, which are then used in a simple "street" version
of craps.	Includes some decent, fully-validated, JavaScript code.

Nav_bar_display_all.html displays several of the menu bars I used for my site at www.bruceAsmith.com
and is helpful when coming up with color schemes.
